# automated routine 1:
# replace an xfmr with larger ampacity on various branches and determine the xfmr that
# -> reduces line congestion the most
# -> reduced fault currents the most
# -> reduces line+xfmr overloading the most

# automated routine 2:
# add a transmission line to various buses and determine the bus that
# -> reduces line congestion the most
# -> reduces fault currents the most
# -> reduces line+xfmr overloading the most

# routine 3:
# given a bus of interest,
# add a transmission line and return summary of changes to congestion, fault currents, and line+xfmr loading
